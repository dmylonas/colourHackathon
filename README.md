# colourHackathon
Count colour words in text mini hackathon

In this mini hackathon, we will explore the frequency of colour terms in Wittgenstein’s Remarks on Colour (1951/1977). Participants will learn how to read a text document, pre-process it, count colour terms and visualise them using Python and the corresponding colours from Colournamer, an online application trained by the participants’ responses of an online colour naming experiment. No previous knowledge of Python is assumed but experience in other programming languages would be an advantage. Participants are advised to install the latest Python Anaconda Distribution on their PC in advance.

# Instructions 

•	Download .txt files from https://github.com/dmylonas/colourHackathon. 

•	Open Jupyter Notebook on your browser, browse to the directory where you downloaded the data and create a new Python 3 notebook.

•	Load text data in Python.

•	Clean and split text into words for text analysis.

•	Count the frequency of colour words and sort them.

•	Visualise the frequency of colour words in Python using Colournamer.
